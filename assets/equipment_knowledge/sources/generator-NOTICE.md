# Credits and attribution

This tool stands on community reverse engineering of Diablo 4's loot filter
format and datamined game data. Thanks to:

- **ThunderEagle / D4LootBench** (MIT License): the `data/*.json` files (affixes,
  uniques, talisman sets, item types) are derived from their `d4-data.json`
  (CASC-extracted affix/item/set SNO ids).
  https://github.com/ThunderEagle/D4LootBench
- **fnuecke / diablo4-loot-filter-viewer**: the protobuf schema
  (`diablo4-loot-filter.proto`) and a second independent affix id table used to
  cross-check ids. https://github.com/fnuecke/diablo4-loot-filter-viewer
- **Upsilon72 / d4-filter-generator**: original reverse engineering of the base64
  protobuf import code format and the first affix id tables.

- **d4lfteam / d4lf**: reference for build site extraction and affix name
  matching. https://github.com/d4lfteam/d4lf
- **DiabloTools / d4data**: the CoreTOC SNO tables underlying the datamined ids.
